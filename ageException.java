    What is Exception Handling?
      Exception handling is a programming mechanism that allows a program to gracefully deal with unexpected events or
      errors during runtime, preventing the program from crashing and allowing it to continue executing or recover from
      the error. Instead of halting execution upon encountering an error, exception handling uses specialized blocks of
      code to handle specific types of exceptions, ensuring a smoother user experience and more robust application behavior.
