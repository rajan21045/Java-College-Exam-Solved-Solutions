/*
 What is Garbage Collection (GC) in Java?
 Garbage Collection is the process by which Java automatically frees up memory by destroying objects that are no longer in use or not referenced anymore.

In Java, memory is allocated for objects in the heap. When an object is no longer needed, the garbage collector deletes it so that memory can be reused.

Why GC Is Needed?

1. To avoid memory leaks
2. To reuse memory efficiently
3.To reduce chances of OutOfMemoryError

How to Achieve Garbage Collection?
In Java, garbage collection happens automatically, but you can suggest it manually using:
System.gc();
This is just a request, not a command. The JVM decides when to actually run GC.
